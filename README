Usage: 

1. Set the IP or hostname of your Apple TV in the target build settings next to ATV_ADDRESS.
2. Build - a new app will install on your AppleTV with a Joypad Menu.
3. Start Joypad on your iPhone and then click "Connect to Joypad" menu item on Apple TV.
   A controller will slide up on your Joypad (make sure your iPhone is on the same wifi network).
4. SSH into your Apple TV and tail the log at /var/log/syslog.  When you move the analog stick 
   on Joypad, you will see updates to the log.

* This is a work in progress.  If those instructions didn't make sense, then this repo isn't ready for you yet :)
The regular Joypad SDK (the one that is live on getjoypad.com/sdk.html) is very well documented and easy to use.

JoypadManager cannot be used in BRBaseAppliance.  It will crash AppleTV.app once a device is found; 
I'm not sure why this happens.
